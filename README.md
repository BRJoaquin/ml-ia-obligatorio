## Project Description

![Team](/assets/team.png)

The aim of this project is to apply machine learning classification techniques to the problem of object detection in images, specifically focusing on face detection. We will use the simpler machine learning-based algorithms due to their lower computational cost, which makes them suitable for modern devices.

## Image and Features

We'll work with grayscale images, representing each image as a 2D matrix. Instead of working with pixels directly, our approach will be based on extracting features.

## Face Detectors

We'll build face detectors from classifiers. We'll have a training dataset consisting of images with labels indicating if it's a face or not. Our main goal will be to develop lightweight classifiers (computationally speaking) to detect if an image is a face.

## Haar Features

We'll use a standard set of features, called Haar features. These features are computationally efficient as they do not require multiplication (a costlier operation), they simply add and subtract pixel values.

## Integral Image

To calculate rectangle features quickly, we'll use an intermediate representation for the image called integral image. It allows us to calculate the sum of the pixels in a rectangle with a constant amount of operations.

## Attentional Cascade

In detecting less frequent objects, such as faces, there's a mechanism called attentional cascade that allows us to construct a cascade of classifiers that achieves higher detection performance while radically reducing execution time.

## Implementation Steps

The following tasks should be developed:

1. **Preprocessing**: Define the initial image processing steps, such as normalization, rescaling, and application of general transformations.

2. **Features**: Clearly define the process of extracting Haar features and constructing the feature matrix.

3. **Classifiers**: Implement the classification algorithms seen in the course, including ensemble techniques.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate various classifiers using validation and model evaluation techniques seen in the course. Use different metrics relevant to the classification problem (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curves, etc).

5. **Attentional Cascade**: Implement the classification mechanism by classifier cascade.

## Technology Stack

This project will be implemented using Python, with development conducted in Jupyter notebooks. The Scikit-learn package will be extensively used for building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Target Audience

This project is intended as a submission for the course "Machine Learning for Artificial Intelligence". The target audience for this document and the associated implementation are the course instructors.
